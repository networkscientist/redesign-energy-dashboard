# Redesign Energiedashboard - Hackdays BE 2025

> **Warning**
All used data is from OGD. Sources and documentation will follow soon...

Please note: All of the code that was released into the first release `hackdays.2025.be` has been written by the team of hacking volunteers. They worked on the project during the Data Hackdays BE 2025, using open government data (OGD) and their private computers. I did not write any of the code in that release, but merely removed a few lines that included personal information to protect their privacy. As stated on the hackdays website, the code has already been published under the CC-BY 4.0 Licence. I created this repo so team members can easily get the code.

The same is true for the data used in the dashboard. All of it has already been published as OGD and been documented on opendata.swiss, along with the licence. While I provided the team with directions where they could find these OGD, it was left to them to transform it into a useful format. However, Github does not allow me to upload files larger than 25 MB; thus, I will kick out some columns that are not needed from the data and then upload it onto this repo, along with thourough documentation of the sources and transformation steps.

Eventually, the dashboard will be linked to streamlit cloud, so anyone can test a live demo of it. And, if this proves useful, I might also add or alter code in the future. The initial contribution by the hackers, however, will still be available under the tag `hackdays.2025.be`.

Stay tuned...
